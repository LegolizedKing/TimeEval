# timeeval-algorithms repository fixture

The files in this folder are used by the algorithm stub generator tests and resemble the folder structure of the [timeeval-algorithms](https://github.com/timeeval/timeeval-algorithms) repository.

The folders `results`, `data`, and `.ci` should be ignored by the code generator.
